* Current design
  1. The major caveat in passing message to the Rpi with the current
     design is that the strings are all expected to be _16 values
     separated by commas_.  This is currently handled by looping over
     =vials= which has a list of 16 integers, and populating lists
     like volumes, rates, and periods by looking up indices from other
     data sources like user defined variables.  This is pretty low
     level right now, and there is no real API to arbitrarily control
     sleeve behavior without resorting to hacks like creating custom
     log files for history dependent control of sleeves
  2. There are low level (arduino-level) event logging requirements
     which are going to be important to debug. This will impact things
     like:
     1. Frequency of data logging
     2. Types of data that are logged systematically (pump events in
        chemostat mode etc)
* Issues
I am not a fan of this design, where the custom script is loaded in
order to first load parameters, but control is then handed back to
eVOLVER.py.  [[file:eVOLVER.py::import custom_script from custom_script import EXP_NAME from custom_script import CALIB_NAME from custom_script import EVOLVER_PORT, OPERATION_MODE from custom_script import STIR_INITIAL, TEMP_INITIAL][Custom imports]]
- Ideally, the config file is read once, and parameters are passed
  around in some data class or similar. See Issue [[http:github.com/amoghpj/evolver/issues/1]].
- No consistent API in adding custom experiment handling. Need to move
  away from using per-vial logic in a loop like it is currently setup.
- Define defaults for stirring control that are passed explicitly to each function definition

* Calibration strategy
  We can perform an in-vial calibration by diluting out a dense culture by
  dispensing media of fixed volumes repeatedly.  Interestingly, performing a
  100X dilution in steps uses far less media than doing it in a single step.
  The total volume of media consumed as the bolus size â†’ 0 is - volume_vial * log(endOD/startOD).

  Below is a visual depiction of the relationship between bolus size, number of steps needed to
  hit endOD, and the total volume dispensed.
